    MINIO_ROOT_USER=minioadmin
    MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD=minioadmin123
    MINIO_BUCKET_NAME=secure-file-vault
    MINIO_ENDPOINT_URL=http://minio:9000
    MINIO_REGION=us-east-1

    # Frontend settings
    REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api

    # Encryption settings
    ENCRYPTION_KEY=a-y9AZNVRZsdeag-1VtQkIfkVzcJxyBUAmN4TVFgZZw=

    # CORS settings
    CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,http://127.0.0.1:3000

    STORAGE_BACKEND=s3
   ```

4. Start the application:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

5. Access the application:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - Backend API: http://localhost:8000/api
   - MinIO Console: http://localhost:9001
   - MinIO API: http://localhost:9000

## Development Setup

### Backend Development

1. Create and activate virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
   # or
   .\venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run migrations:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

4. Start development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

### Frontend Development

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

2. Start development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Production Deployment

1. Update environment variables:
   - Set `DJANGO_DEBUG=False`
   - Use strong secret keys
   - Configure proper CORS settings
   - Set up a production database

2. Build and deploy:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up --build
   ```

## API Documentation

The API documentation is available at `/api/docs/` when running the backend server.

# Project Submission Instructions

## Preparing Your Submission

1. Before creating your submission zip file, ensure:
   - All features are implemented and working as expected
   - All tests are passing
   - The application runs successfully locally
   - Remove any unnecessary files or dependencies
   - Clean up any debug/console logs

2. Create the submission zip file:
   ```bash
   # Activate your backend virtual environment first
   cd backend
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # Run the submission script from the project root
   cd ..
   python create_submission_zip.py
   ```

   The script will:
   - Create a zip file named `username_YYYYMMDD.zip` (e.g., `johndoe_20240224.zip`)
   - Respect .gitignore rules to exclude unnecessary files
   - Preserve file timestamps
   - Show you a list of included files and total size
   - Warn you if the zip is unusually large

3. Verify your submission zip file:
   - Extract the zip file to a new directory
   - Ensure all necessary files are included
   - Verify that no unnecessary files (like node_modules, __pycache__, etc.) are included
   - Test the application from the extracted files to ensure everything works

## Video Documentation Requirement

**Video Guidance** - Record a screen share demonstrating:
- How you leveraged Gen AI to help build the features
- Your prompting techniques and strategies
- Any challenges you faced and how you overcame them
- Your thought process in using AI effectively

**IMPORTANT**: Please do not provide a demo of the application functionality. Focus only on your Gen AI usage and approach.

## Submission Process

1. Submit your project through this Google Form:
   [Project Submission Form](https://forms.gle/nr6DZAX3nv6r7bru9)

2. The form will require:
   - Your project zip file (named `username_YYYYMMDD.zip`)
   - Your video documentation
   - Any additional notes or comments about your implementation

Make sure to test the zip file and video before submitting to ensure they are complete and working as expected.
